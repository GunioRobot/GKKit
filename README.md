## Purpose
Collection of Cocoa classes and various headers I use throughout my work. Hosted for submodule support in my other projects.

## License
Don't sue me I'm poor, use as is, no warrenty, request recognition but don't really care either way, enjoy :)

## To-Do
- Really need to clean up dependencies for GKDataRequest, probably my favorite and most robust class but it depends too much on a lot of things like asi-http-request
- debug.h needs a huge overhaul which I've never gotten around too, ideally I want a c function that uses type modifiers to guess kind of object, be it int/float/objc_obj/etc., i started it but never finished, as well as fix changes for certain objects from mac to iOS, such as CGRect to string functions.
- GKSearchController needs to be cleaned up to seperate it's uses from GKActivityView
